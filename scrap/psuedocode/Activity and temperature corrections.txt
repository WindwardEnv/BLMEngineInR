subroutine TempCorrrection
  Inputs:
	SysTemp 	: the tempature for the current simulation
	Nr          : the number of reactions (could be either number of species, or number of phases)
	LogK[1..Nr]	: the log K values for formation reactions  - either species or phases reactions could be passed in
	Temp[1..Nr]	: the temperature that the log Ks were measured at
	DeltaH[1..Nr]	: the change in enthalpy for each species formation reaction
   Outputs:
	HLogK[1..Nr]	: the enthalpy corrected log Ks for species
	
   Local variables:
	i : integer: loop counter
	HEC : enthalply corrected equilibiurm constants
	Rcon : universal gas constant (Rcon = 8.314)
	T0, T1, T2 : temparary temperature variables

	*  Check to see if temperature correction can be performed
