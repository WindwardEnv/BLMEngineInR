  Inputs:
	SysTemp 	: the tempature for the current simulation
	LogKs[1..Ns]	: the log K values for the species formation reactions 
	SpecTemp[1..Ns]	: the temperature that the log Ks were measured at
	DeltaH[1..Ns]	: the change in enthalpy for each species formation reaction
  Outputs:
	HLogKs[1..Ns]	: the enthalpy corrected log Ks
