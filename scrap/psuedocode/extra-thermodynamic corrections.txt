Temperature correction
  - adjusts the SpecK variable 
    --> let's save SpecKTempAdj as a new adjusted version of the SpecK variable
    --> DONE: change SpecK references in CHESS functions to SpecKTempAdj
  - DONE: write TempCorrection function
      TempCorrection = function(Temp, NSpec, SpecK, SpecDeltaH, SpecTemp){
        ...{look this up in PB program}
        return(SpecKTempAdj)
      }
  - DONE: compile deltaH and Temp values for test parameter files
  
Ionic strength adjustments
  - this involves calculating activity coefficients and applying the corrections to the concentrations when calculating species concentrations
  - we'll have a new vector SpecActivities...this will need to be used when we do CalcSpecConc
    - DONE: write CalcIonicStrength function
    - TODO: will need to have a function for each option
      - DONE: Ext D-H
      - DONE: Davies?
      - TODO: WHAM?        
      - TODO: MoleFraction?
      - TODO: ChargeFraction?
    - DONE: write functions for applying and un-applying activity corrections - integrated into CalcSpecConc by making SpecActivityCoef an input argument...if activities are needed elsewhere, we can easily change this.
    - DONE: change references of CompConc to CompActivities and SpecConc to SpecActivities in CalcSpecConc

Diffuse double layer 
  - TODO: look back at marine Ni project...how far we got, what we learned
