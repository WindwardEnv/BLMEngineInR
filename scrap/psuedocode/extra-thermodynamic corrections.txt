Temperature correction
  - adjusts the SpecK variable 
    --> let's save SpecKTempAdj as a new adjusted version of the SpecK variable
    --> TODO: change SpecK references in CHESS functions to SpecKTempAdj
  - TODO: write TempCorrection function
      TempCorrection = function(Temp, NSpec, SpecK, SpecDeltaH, SpecTemp){
        ...{look this up in PB program}
        return(SpecKTempAdj)
      }
  - TODO: compile deltaH and Temp values for test parameter files
  
Ionic strength adjustments
  - this involves calculating activity coefficients and applying the corrections to the concentrations when calculating species concentrations
  - we'll have a new vector SpecActivities...this will need to be used when we do CalcSpecConc
    - TODO: write CalcIonicStrength function
    - TODO: will need to have a function for each option...at a minimum Ext D-H
    - TODO: write functions for applying and un-applying activity corrections
    - TODO: change references of CompConc to CompActivities and SpecConc to SpecActivities in CalcSpecConc

Diffuse double layer 
  - TODO: look back at marine Ni project...how far we got, what we learned
