Description: THIS PACKAGE IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. This package is the Biotic 
    Ligand Model (BLM) engine developed by Windward Environmental, LLC. The BLM 
    was originally programmed in 'PowerBasic' by Robert Santore and others. The 
    main way the BLM can be used is to predict the toxicity of a metal to an 
    organism with a known sensitivity (i.e., it is known how much of that metal 
    must accumulate on that organism's biotic ligand to cause a physiological 
    effect in a certain percentage of the population, such as a 20% loss in 
    reproduction or a 50% mortality rate). The second way the BLM can be used 
    is to estimate the chemical speciation of the metal and other constituents 
    in water, including estimating the amount of metal accumulated to an 
    organism's biotic ligand during a toxicity test. In the first application 
    of the BLM, the amount of metal will be predicted, while in the second 
    application, the amount of metal is known and the portions of that metal 
    that exist in various forms will be determined.
