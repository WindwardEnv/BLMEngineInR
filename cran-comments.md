## Submission

Changes made:

-   Switched from MIT license to Apache 2.0. This was the intended license with the previous submission and was changed to MIT by mistake.
-   Updated "description" field in the DESCRIPTION file to be more descriptive of what this package does. Also included the standard overview and relevant literature list we have on our website in the README file.
-   Re-vamped the examples in documentation, and added tests to the testthat folder along the same vein.
